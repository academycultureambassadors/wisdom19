        <h2>About The Conference</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of professionals who are together in support of a common cause. Our cause is to share
            expertise on how to
            create and sustain positive workplace cultures. The interactive format with all participants including the
            speakers
            is something that isn’t seen anywhere else. It emphasizes friendships with like-minded people and taking
            home
            fresh new implementable ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a small prestigious group by design. The planned attendance each year is for a ratio of 2/3
            returning alumni and
            1/3 new registrants. Each group is on a first come first served basis. For 2019 there will be eight round
            tables
            with 8 persons per table. This includes all speakers who are with us for both days.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not an event for glitz and party time. As one of our alumni put it, it is a place for those who
            choose passion over
            pomp and circumstance. The retreat is not a place for lectures. It is a place to hear about and discuss
            stories
            about the "why?" and "how to? of creating and maintaining a great workplace culture". We don't just go for
            big
            names. We go for speakers who know what they are talking about because they've been there. There is no
            sales
            or marketing of products or services.
        </p>

        <p>We would like you to join us if want to be a part of kindred spirits who want to push the boundaries of the
            modern
            workplace and face the challenges presented by environment, economy, and societal sustainability; if you
            believe
            that humanizing workplaces is the right thing to do, and that happy employees have a positive effect on
            business
            performance, their families, and their communities; and if you are committed to creating and cultivating
            joyful,
            supportive, fulfilling work environments.</p>

        <h2>Meeting Place</h2>
        <p>
            Our meeting place is the magnificent Cliff House hotel in Manitou Springs, CO. It is literally across the
            corner from the
            start of the quaint downtown main street. Everything you will want is only steps away including cafes,
            coffee
            houses and shopping. This is a wonderful place to bring your family for a few days of vacation in the cool
            mountain
            air. It might be perfect timing for Aspen tree fall colors. Manitou Springs is on the west edge of Colorado
            Springs,
            CO.

        <h2>Lodging</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.thecliffhouse.com/" title="Cliff House Hotel in Manitou Springs, CO.">The Cliff House</a>
            is a luxury hotel. If you prefer, there are many options in Manitou Springs and Colorado Springs is nearby.
            We are not holding
            a block of rooms so make reservations directly on line at their web site.
        </p>
        <p>There are relatively few rooms at the Cliff House. <a href="https://reservations.travelclick.com/4780?groupID=2362018">Click
                here to reserve a room</a>. There are several hotels within walking distance but most are not what one
            might
            call "chain name recognized". Colorado Springs next door has everything but for that you'll need a car,
            taxi,
            Lyft, or Uber. </p>
        <p>There are many wonderful places for food in Manitou Springs. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/LangRedirect?auto=3&origin=en_US&pool=X&returnTo=/Restaurants-g33537-Manitou_Springs_El_Paso_County_Colorado.html">You

    <section class="meals" id="meals">
        <h2>Small Groups for Meals</h2>
        <p>We have found that self-organized small groups for lunches and dinners is a nice way
            to make solid acquaintances and it&#39;s fun. Each group forms itself, decides themselves
            where to go and each pay for their own food and drinks. Here is what we'll do. You will have 4 colors of
            sticky dots. Red means lunch on October 1, green means dinner on October 1, blue means lunch on October
            2 and yellow means lunch on October 3. Put the sticky dots on your name tag for those you want to
            join. Then gather in the lobby area after the last presentations at lunch times and form groups. For dinner
            gather at 6 p.m. and do the same. </p>
